      <h2>
        In a general context, the Judgement Tarot card can indicate that you
        and/or someone you care about are being judged too harshly by others. It
        can also indicate that you are judging people harshly or making snap
        judgements yourself. Alternatively, Judgement can also be an indication
        that you have achieved a level of clarity and composure that allows you
        to calmly evaluate yourself and your choices in order to make positive
        decisions. You have come through your past karmic lessons with increased
        self-awareness and you are allowing healing to take place so you can
        move forward in a positive direction. If you have a big decision to make
        when this Major Arcana card appears, use the karmic lessons you have
        learnt from the past to help you make the right choice. Judgement
        upright can represent a legal matter or court case being resolved. If
        you have acted honourably and told the truth, this matter should be
        resolved in your favour. If you have been dishonest, dont expect things
        to go your way. You need to clear your conscience and try to make amends
        for your misdeeds. This Major Arcana card can also signify being
        separated from someone you love by an ocean or sea. You can expect to be
        reunited with them soon when it appears. It can also indicate
        homesickness.
