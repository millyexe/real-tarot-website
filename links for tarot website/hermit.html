      <h2>
        The Hermit Tarot card in an upright position generally indicates that
        you are entering a period of soul searching, self-reflection and
        spiritual enlightenment. You may find that you need time alone to gain a
        deeper understanding of yourself, to remove yourself from the daily
        grind in order to discover your true spiritual self, contemplate your
        existence, your direction in life or your values. The Hermit can also
        indicate isolating yourself or withdrawing into oneself in order to
        recover from a difficult situation. This Major Arcana trump card can
        suggest that you may be going through an anti-social phase where you
        just dont want to interact with people as much as you normally would.
        The Hermit is wise, mature and knowledgeable and may be an indication of
        someone seeking the services of a counsellor or psychiatrist. This is a
        time to focus on yourself and meeting your own needs.
